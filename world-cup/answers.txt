Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:
I think 10 simulations.


Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:
I would call 10000 predictions ,It wouldn't take even 1 second an It's accurate enough so It's good enough.
